- use em units (don't use pixels)
- you can use default font & approx. font size
- logos and icons can be found in /images folder
- orange color should be used #ff6634
- links can be faked (e.g. href="#")
- follow HTML5 and CSS3 rules and features
- nothing else is strictly specified, you can use whatever tool/technique/approach you want

Minimum requirements:
- pull repo from Github and work in your own branch
- integrate "Retail chains index" section (that one with dark grey background) of the page including all elements and the copy upon visual
- bring JQuery library into this project
- fetch index average eValue Score from mock API endpoint (e.g. 78) which is in /api/score.json
- add hover states for facebook icon top left (hover and active states use orange background)
- create github pull request to this repository and provide the link

Advanced (optional) - any of these will be taken as BIG plus for you:
- use SASS instead of pure CSS
- set different breakpoints to support mobile, tablet and desktop (using Bootstrap CSS or similar)
- integrate header section with logo on the left and login box
- integrate login box with onclick event similar to login box at https://www.evaluesuite.com/ (just design + form, no login functionality needed)
