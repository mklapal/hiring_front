=========================

Goal:
Integrate part of the webpage from the design provided in images folder.

Details for integration:
- page uses fixed width 768px, all positions should fit within this width
- use em units
- you can use default font & approx. font size
- logos and icons can be found in ```/images``` folder
- orange color should be used ```#ff6634```
- links can be faked (e.g. ```href="#"```)
- follow HTML5 and CSS3 rules and features
- nothing else is strictly specified, you can use whatever tool/technique/approach you want

Minimum requirements:
- pull repo from Github and work in your own branch
- integrate "Retail chains index" section (that one with dark grey background) of the page including all elements and the copy upon visual (see attached PDF or AI or PNG in ```/visuals``` for more details)
- bring JQuery library into this project
- use ajax to fetch index average eValue Score from mock API endpoint which is in ```/api/score.json```
- add hover states for facebook icon top left (hover and active states use orange background)
- create github pull request to this repository and provide the link

Advanced (optional) - any of these will be taken as BIG plus for you:
- use SASS/SCSS instead of pure CSS
- set different breakpoints to support mobile, tablet and desktop (may use Bootstrap CSS or similar)
- integrate header section with logo on the left and login box
- integrate login box with onclick event similar to login box at [https://www.evaluesuite.com/](https://www.evaluesuite.com/) (just design + form, no login functionality needed)
